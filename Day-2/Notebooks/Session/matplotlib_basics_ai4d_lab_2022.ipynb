    "<h2 style=\"color:green;\">What is Matplotlib?</h2>    \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Matplotlib**     is a Python package for 2D plotting that generates production-quality graphs. It supports interactive and non-interactive plotting, and can save images in several output formats (PNG, PS, and others).\n",
    "  - It provides a wide variety of plot types (lines, bars, pie charts, histograms, and many more). In addition to this, it is highly customizable, flexible, and easy to use.\n",
    "  - The dual nature of Matplotlib allows it to be used in both interactive and non-interactive scripts. It can be used in scripts without a graphical display, embedded in graphical applications, or on web pages. It can also be used interactively with the Python interpreter or IPython.\n",
    "  - **Matplotlib** was born in the scientific area of computing, where **gnuplot** and **MATLAB** were (and still are) used a lot.\n",
    "  - **Matplotlib** was modeled on **MATLAB**, because graphing was something that MATLAB did very well. The high degree of compatibility between them made many people move from **MATLAB** to **Matplotlib**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<h2 style=\"color:green;\">But what are the points that built the success of Matplotlib?</h2>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some of them:\n",
    " \n",
    " - **It uses Python:** \n",
    "  - Python is a very interesting language for scientific purposes (it's interpreted, high-level, easy to learn, easily extensible, and has a powerful standard library) and is now used by major institutions such as NASA, JPL, Google, DreamWorks, Disney, and many more.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - **It's open source, so no license to pay:**\n",
    "  - This makes it very appealing for professors and students, who often have a low budget.\n",
    "  \n",
    " -  **It's very customizable and extensible:** \n",
    "  - Matplotlib can fit every use case because it has a lot of graph types, features, and configuration options.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - **It's cross-platform and portable:** \n",
    "  - Matplotlib can run on Linux, Windows,Mac OS X, and Sun Solaris (and Python can run on almost every architecture available).\n",
    "  \n",
    "<h2 style=\"color:green;\">About dependencies</h2>  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Matplotlib has its origin in scientific fields, so it is commonly used to plot huge datasets. Python's native support for long lists becomes impractical for such sizes, so Matplotlib needs better support for arrays, so NumPy has to be available to use Matplotlib.\n",
    " - **Build dipendencies**\n",
    "  - **Python:** Version (>=3.6)\n",
    "  - **NumPy:** Version (>=1.11) \n",
    "  - **libpng:** Version 1.2 or higher is needed to load or save PNG images (Windows users can skip this requirement)\n",
    "  - **FreeType:** Version 2.3 or higher is needed for reading TrueType font files (Windows users can skip this requirement)\n",
    "  \n",
    "<h2 style=\"color:green;\">Installing Matplotlib</h2>  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Installing Matplotlib on Linux**\n",
    " - In the following table, we will present some of the common Linux distributions package names for Matplotlib and the tools we can use to install the package:\n",
    " \n",
    "**Distribution**        |       **Package Name**\n",
    "----------------------  |  -------------------------------\n",

    "Red hat                                                         |  <code>sudo yum install python3-matplotlib</code>\n",
    "Arch                                                            |  <code>sudo pacman -S python-matplotlib</code>\n",
